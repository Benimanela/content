# Thales CipherTrust Manager

Thales CipherTrust Manager integrates with Palo Alto Networkâ€™s Cortex XSOAR to streamline the management of sensitive data and secure access. The integration provides security teams with essential tools to configure, manage, and monitor user groups and digital certificates efficiently. For instance, when a suspicious action is detected within the CipherTrust Manager, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual certificate requests, security teams can immediately modify user permissions, enforce stricter authentication processes, or revoke compromised certificates.


## What does this pack do?

This pack provides comprehensive tools and functionalities centered around three main use cases to enhance security and management within the platform:

- **Groups Management**: It allows for the organization and definition of permissions within User Defined and System Defined Groups. This is essential for structuring operational hierarchy and ensuring effective access control across the platform.

- **Users Management**: The pack supports efficient user account management with secure access capabilities. It facilitates authentication across multiple systems, including LDAP and AD, enabling a streamlined and secure user management process.

- **Certificate Authority Management**: The pack includes features to manage digital certificates, which are vital for maintaining secure communication channels. It enables the creation and management of both local and external Certificate Authorities (CAs), and the generation and issuance of certificates to ensure communication security.


### Use Cases

The pack includes an integration that supports several practical use cases:

- **Groups Management**: Organize users and define permissions through User Defined and System Defined Groups, critical for maintaining operational hierarchy and effective access control within the platform.

- **Users Management**: Secure access and manage accounts efficiently. This functionality supports authentication across various systems including LDAP and AD, ensuring robust and versatile user management capabilities.

- **Certificate Authority Management**: Handle digital certificates crucial for secure communications. This includes the ability to create and manage both local and external Certificate Authorities (CAs), and generate and issue certificates, ensuring that secure communication channels are established and maintained.

For detailed description of each of the use cases, see the integration documentation.
