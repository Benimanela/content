#### Integrations

##### EWS v2

- Fixed an issue so that EML files downloaded from the ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **fetch_emails_as_incidents** will now retain CRLF line separators.
- Fixed an issue where **get_item_as_eml** and **parse_incident_from_item** failed due to having multiple headers of the same type.
- Fixed an issue in the ***ews-get-items-as-eml*** command and **parse_incident_from_item** that 
  could result in duplicated headers in EML file results.
- Added support for using the subject of ItemAttachment as its name when the attachment lacks a name.
