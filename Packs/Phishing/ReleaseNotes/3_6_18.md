- New: XSOAR SAAS. This playbook investigates and remediates a potential phishing incident. It engages with the user who triggered the incident while investigating the incident itself.

- Final remediation tasks are manual by default. can be managed by "SearchAndDelete" and "BlockIndicators" inputs. 
- Do not rerun this playbook inside a phishing incident since it can produce an unexpected result. Create a new incident instead if needed.<~XSIAM> (Available from Cortex XSIAM %%XSIAM_VERSION%%).</~XSIAM>
