#### Integrations

##### Cortex XDR - IOC

- Fixed **fetch-indicators** functionality- now the first sync to xdr is incremental by modification time. After the first phase is done will use the original flow.
- Fixed the **fetch-indicators** in the second phase in order to treat xsoar as the main source- first sending changes from XSOAR to XDR and then from XDR to XSOAR.
