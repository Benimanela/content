##### Cortex XDR - IOC

- Updated **fetch-indicators** functionality- now the first sync to xdr is incremental by modification time. After the first phase is done will use the original flow.
- Updated the **fetch-indicators** sync changes- in order to treat xsoar as the main source, first sending changes from XSOAR to XDR and then from XDR to XSOAR.
