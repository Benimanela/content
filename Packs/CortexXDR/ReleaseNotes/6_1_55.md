- Add a new playbook to handle T1036-Masquerading alerts

##### New: Cortex XDR - T1036 - Masquerading

- New: This playbook handles masquerading alerts based on the MITRE T1036 technique.
An attacker might leverage Microsoft Windows' well-known image names to run malicious processes without being caught.

**Attacker's Goals:**

An attacker attempts to masquerade as standard Windows images by using a trusted name to execute malicious code.

**Investigative Actions:**

Enrich and Investigate the executed process image and endpoint and verify if it is malicious using:

* File Reputation
* NSRL DB
* CommandLine Analysis
* Related Alerts


**Response Actions**

When the playbook executes, it checks for additional activity, and if a malicious behavior is found, the playbook proceeds with the following containment actions:

* Auto Process termination
* Auto file quarantine
