#### Integrations

##### Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - IOC

- Fixed **fetch-indicators** functionality- now the first sync to xdr is incremental by modification time. After the first phase will use the original flow.
- Fixed the **fetch-indicators** in the second phase to treat xsoar as the main source- first sending changes from XSOAR to XDR and then from XDR to XSOAR.
