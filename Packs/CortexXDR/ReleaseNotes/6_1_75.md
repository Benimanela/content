#### Integrations

##### Cortex XDR - IOC

- Fixed an issue where **fetch-indicators** failed to sync large amount of indicators after instance setup or reset. As part od this fix the initial sync to XDR is now incremental, in batches of 40,000, based on modification time
- Updated the **fetch-indicators** sync order changes: in order to treat XSOAR as the main source, first sending changes from XSOAR to XDR and then from XDR to XSOAR.
